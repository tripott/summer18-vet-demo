# Vet Support Resources User Stories

The veteran support resources app helps veterans locate and contact the resources they need.

## View Home

As a veteran, once the application is launched, I desire the ability to see more information about the app, including its purpose. I also desire a way to navigate to the major features within the app via some sort of menu or buttons, so that I can find resources to help me and my family. Clicking a menu button or icon, will display menu items. Clicking the **Resources** menu item, will navigate me to a **List Resources**. Clicking **Categories** menu item, will navigate me to **List Categories**.

## List Resources

As a veteran, I desire the ability to view a listing of all the resources within the tri country area, so that I can select an item in the list based on my needs and learn more information about that resources. Within the list I wish to see the name name of the resource and a basic description and the resource category.

## View Navigation Menu

As a user, I desire the ability to navigate to resources, categories, in memory, legal, about from "top/first level" pages within my app so that I can easily navigate around the application.

Clicking the navigation menu, will display a list of "top level" navigation items such as:

- Resources (List Resources)
- Categories (List Categories)
- In Memory (View In Memory)
- Legal (View Legal)
- About (View About)

## View Resource

As a veteran, I desire the ability to view an individual resource in more detail so that I can determine if this resource meets my need and how to contact the resource and find the resource.

I wish to see the following information:

- resource Name
- address
- map
- phone
- short description of the resource
- long desc

Clicking a back button will return me to the previous screen, most likely the **List Resources**.

## List Categories

As a veteran, I desire the ability to view a listing of categories of resources so that I can find the resources I need. Once a list of categories is displayed, clicking on an item in the list will allow me to **View a Category**.

## View a Category

As a veteran, I desire the ability to view details about a category and a list of filtered resources for the selected category, so that I can see all the related resources for the selected category.
